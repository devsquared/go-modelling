# godel
Godel is pronounced like yodel. Or maybe like yah-del. Or, if you are a mathematician, like the greatest logician to 
ever walk with Einstein.

Simple and basic modelling in go. 

## Reasoning
This repo was created with the goal of creating an easy way to model state machines in go. I found myself struggling
with other modelling languages and wanted to explore potentially interop with go applications themselves through annotations,
code generators, test assistant code, or similar. I also wanted to just understand state machines and modelling better; no better way
than doing it yourself. 


## TODO: 
- [ ] Make sure we can marshal and unmarshal JSON effectively
- [ ] Explore some kind of simple graphical output
  - [ ] Output to markdown with a simple model and description would be very helpful
- [ ] Could we explore annotating go code to read and produce a state machine model?
